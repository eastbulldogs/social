# Project Requirements and Planning

## Content Structure
The primary curriculum for the course is medieval world history, with a heavy focus on how geography affects civilizations, usually by way of trade. Units of study include Europe, the Middle East, West Africa, China, Japan, and Mesoamerica.

## Interactive Elements
I'd like to include interactive maps, timelines, quizzes, choose-your-own-adventure type click through games, and other similar edutainment. 

## Access Considerations
Students will primarily be accessing with their school laptops, most of which are Dell Latitudes. 

## Media Usage
I plan to incorporate images hosted on Github, and embed videos from either Youtube or OneDrive.

## Update Frequency
I plan to update very frequently as we build the site, and then only occasionally add or update pages as we move through units.
