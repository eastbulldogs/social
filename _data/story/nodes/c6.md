I'll write C6 (Stay Loyal/Earn Trust) which is the alternate path from discovering the hidden message as a messenger. This follows from B3 but shows the choice to respect the messenger's code of secrecy, leading to either accepting a special mission or focusing on traditional training.

Here's C6, focusing on themes of loyalty and trust:

Forcing yourself to ignore the hidden message, you carefully deliver both pieces of parchment exactly as they were given to you. Your hands feel sweaty, but you remember Thomas's words about the importance of trust. A messenger who reads private messages won't be trusted with any messages at all.

Just before sunset, you find Thomas waiting in the small messenger's courtyard. His expression is unusually serious. "I saw you notice the second message earlier," he says quietly. "But you delivered it untouched. Not many young ones would have done that."

He leads you to a part of the castle you've never seen before – a small room hidden behind a tapestry. Inside, you're surprised to find not just Thomas, but the castle steward and the captain of the guard. They're studying the very message you delivered.

"We've been watching you all day," the steward explains. "That message was a test. We need messengers we can trust completely – especially now." He exchanges glances with the captain. "We're tracking some dangerous people, and we need someone who can carry messages right under their noses without arousing suspicion."

The captain steps forward. "You've proven you can be trusted. But this won't be easy work. You could stick to regular message duties and train to be a traditional castle messenger. Or you could help us with something more... important."

The three men wait for your answer. Both paths serve the castle – but in very different ways.

You have to make a choice:
- Accept the special mission and join their secret work
- Focus on your regular messenger training
