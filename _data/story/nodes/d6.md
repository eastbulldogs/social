Clara's face lights up when you tell her you want to help find a solution that works for everyone. "I knew you had a good heart," she says. Together, you begin planning ways to reduce waste and help those in need without compromising the kitchen's security.

Your days take on a new rhythm. Between regular kitchen duties, you and Clara carefully track leftover food that would normally go to waste. You discover there's quite a bit - bread that's still good but not fresh enough for the lord's table, vegetable trimmings that could make hearty soup, and meat bones perfect for broth.

Other kitchen workers start noticing what you're doing. Some join in, sharing their own ideas for stretching resources. Even Master Gilbert, though he still frowns at the mention of giving away food, seems impressed by how you're handling things properly and keeping records of everything.

Then one morning, Clara pulls you aside, her expression worried. "The castle steward is coming to inspect the kitchen today," she whispers. "He's heard about our program. Some people are saying we're being too generous with the castle's resources." She grips your arm. "We could stop now - say it was just a temporary thing. No one would blame us. Or we could stand together and show him how much good this is doing for everyone."

The whole kitchen seems to hold its breath, waiting to see what you'll do. Will you risk your position to defend what you believe in, or is it time to follow a safer path?

You have to make a choice:
- Stand with Clara and defend the program you've built together
- Step back from the project and focus on traditional kitchen duties
