You follow his gaze to a stall where a young, spirited horse is pawing at the ground, clearly agitated. Its coat is lathered with sweat, and none of the stable boys seem eager to approach.

"Another pair of hands, eh?" she says, looking you over. "Well, timing couldn't be better. We've got a feast to prepare for tonight - Lord Edmund's returning from his travels." She gestures to the organized chaos around you, where kitchen boys and scullery maids hurry about their tasks.

"But first," she continues, lowering her voice, "we've got a more pressing matter. Someone's been taking extra food from the pantry - not much, mind you, but enough to notice. This morning, I saw a boy about your age sneaking away from the kitchen with a loaf of bread under his shirt."`,

Thomas's weathered face breaks into an approving smile. "Good head on your shoulders, lad. That's exactly right - a frightened horse can be dangerous, and there's no shame in asking for help when you need it."

He waves over William, an experienced stable hand. "Will here has a way with difficult horses. Watch carefully now - there's much to learn."

William demonstrates the proper approach, explaining each step as he goes. You notice how he positions himself, the timing of his movements, and the way he reads Thunder's body language.`,
